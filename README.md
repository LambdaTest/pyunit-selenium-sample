After your save your credentials at `lambdatest.env` please run the command: 

```
$ source lambdatest.env
```

### Step 2: Setting up your test capabilites

You can genegate the test capabilites at (https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) and choose **Python** as the language. 

Now, can setup the capabilites of the test in the `single_test.py` file at: 

```
ln 13: desired_caps = {
ln 14:           "build": 'PyunitTest sample build',
ln 15:            "name": 'Py-unittest',
ln 16:           "platform": 'OS X El Capitan',
ln 17:            "browserName": 'chrome',
ln 18:           "version": '81.0',
ln 19:           "console": 'true',
ln 20:           "network":'true'
ln 21:        }

```

You can setup the capabilites of your test in the `parallel_test.py` file at: 

```
browsers = [
    {"build": 'PyunitTest sample build',"name": "Test 1", "platform": "Windows 10","browserName": "Chrome", "version": "86.0"},
    {"build": 'PyunitTest sample build',"name": "Test 2", "platform": "Windows 10","browserName": "Firefox", "version": "82.0"}
]
```

### Step 3: Running Tests
To start a single test Run following command: <br/><br/>

```
$ python single_test.py 
```

To start a parallel test Run the following command: <br/><br/>
```
$ python parallel_test.py
```
